# 📊 IBM Statistics for Data Science with Python – Module 7 Assignment

**Author:** Fahmi Ahmed  
**Compatible with:** JupyterLite (offline)  
**Course:** IBM Statistics for Data Science with Python (Coursera)

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my assignment submission for **Module 7** of the IBM course, focusing on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`. The notebook is specifically written to be **fully compatible with JupyterLite**, which runs entirely in the browser — no installation required and works offline.

---

## 📁 Contents

- `module7_assignment.ipynb` – The main Jupyter Notebook file with:
  - A sample dataset simulating diamond features
  - Data visualizations using matplotlib
  - Grouped statistics and correlation analysis
  - Clear, readable plots designed without seaborn

---

## 📷 Visualizations Included

- 📈 Histogram of diamond prices  
- 📦 Boxplot of carat distribution by cut  
- 🔵 Scatter plot of carat vs price (colored by cut)  
- 🔥 Correlation matrix for numeric features  
- 📊 Bar chart of average price by clarity

## ✅ Why JupyterLite?

This version avoids `seaborn` and other external dependencies so that it can run in **JupyterLite**, a browser-based Jupyter environment. This makes it ideal for:

- Offline analysis  
- Low-resource devices  
- Educational use where package installation is restricted

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo/lab/)
2. Upload the notebook (`module7_assignment.ipynb`)
3. Run each cell using `Shift + Enter`

---

## 🧠 Skills Practiced

- Creating and manipulating DataFrames with `pandas`  
- Basic statistical analysis  
- Data grouping and aggregation  
- Visualization with `matplotlib`  
- Adapting Python notebooks for limited environments
